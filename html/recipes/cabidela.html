    <h1>Cabidela</h1>
    <caption>
        <img src="../../media/images/cabidela.jpg" alt="Cabidela">
        <figcaption>Cabidela is a Portuguese dish consisting of rice and poultry or game meat cooked together with
            animal’s blood. Rice can be cooked alongside meat or served on the side, while red wine or vinegar are
            sometimes
            added to moderate the tartness.

            With its unusual dark color and a creamy texture, cabidela is considered to be a Portuguese specialty, and
            it is traditionally associated with various regions in Northern Portugal. It has also been integrated into
            traditional Brazilian and Angolan cuisine.</figcaption>

        <!-- Ordered list named Steps -->
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the chicken. As you will need to use the chicken’s blood, it’s best if you
                get the chicken from a butcher, since they sell the blood on the side, already blended with red wine
                vinegar. Even better would be to get it straight from a nearby farmer. In a supermarket, make sure that
                they provide you with the chicken blood before you order it.</li>
            <li>Chop the chicken into small bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Peel and chop the onion and the garlic cloves and fry them in a large pan with hot olive oil. Add the
                chorizo and the prosciutto sliced very thin and keep stirring. Once the smoked meats and the onions are
                getting a golden color, add the black beer and the balsamic vinegar.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces, season with salt, pepper, parsley and a little bit of cinnamon (if you like, as
                this is an optional spice) and let it cook for about 10 minutes over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Next, add the rice to the stock in which the chicken has been cooked. You might need to add some hot
                water, depending on the amount of stock you have on the pan, so pay attention throughout the rice
                cooking. Usually, carolino rice demands 3x the amount of water.</li>
            <li>When the rice is just about to be cooked add the blood and vinegar mixture that you got from the
                supermarket. Mix well and simmer for 1-2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
